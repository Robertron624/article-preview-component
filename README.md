## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use the screen.width property to change the layout of the site depending on the screen size of the device and adding event listeners that behave different if the view is mobile or desktop. I also learned how to use the ::before and ::after pseudoelements to create little figures.

### Continued development

I want to keep using vanilla javascript for not so complex projects that require a lot of DOM manipulation. I also want to keep learning some css animation and ::before and ::after pseudoelements for creating little figures.


### Useful resources

- [Screen: width property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen/width) - This is useful for modifying the layout of your site depending on the screen size of the device. I'd recommend this to anyone still learning this concept.
- [How to make an upside down triangle outline in CSS](https://www.example.com) - This stackoverflow question helped me create the little upside down triangle for the share menu in desktop
